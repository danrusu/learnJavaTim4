### Homework â€“ Arrays 2


### *`Tasks - solve one task / class`*
### *`First try to solve the tasks on your own, then consult with coleagues.`*

1. Write a method `createArray` that receives an integer `number` and
 - if the number is less or equal to 0 it returns an empty array of integers
 - if the number is positive it returns an array of `number` values from `number` to 1
 - print the results returned by calling this function for
   - number = -5
   - number = 0
   - number = 7

```
// Result on the console should be:
number = -5 ---> []
number = 0  ---> []
number = 7  ---> [7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
```

2. Create an array named "first" that holds the following values:
```
"We", "are", "coding", "daily".
```

Create another array named "second" that holds:
```
"to", "become", "better", "developers"
```

Create an array named `all` that will hold the values from both the "first"
and the `second` arrays, maintaining the order.

Create a function `printArray` that receives an array
as parameter and returns a string of all elements
separated by space.

Print the result obtained by calling `printArray(all)`

```
//Expected console result
We are coding daily to become better developers
```

3. Write a method named `range` that receives two numbers, `number1`, `number2`
and generates an array of all integer values from `number1` to `number2`.
Print the arrays for calling the function for:
- number1 = 3, number2 = 9
```
//Expected console result
3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
```
- number1 = 7, number2 = -2
```
//Expected console result
7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0, -1, -2
```

4. Write `createMirrorArray` method that receives an integer
`number` and returns an array as in the following example.
Print returned array for `createMirrorArray(-5)` and createMirrorArray(4)
```
System.out.println(createMirrorArray(-5));
// should print: -5 -4 -3 -2 -1 1 2 3 4 5

System.out.println(createMirrorArray(3));
// should print: -3 -2 -1 1 2 3
```
